# Onboarding

## Laptop

You will need to remember a few passwords at Function Health:
- Rippling password
- Okta password
- System password for your laptop

## Okta

You will receive an email from Okta to your personal email.

Setup a password and 2FA for your Okta account, and use it to login on your
work computer after you have it setup. Function's Okta website is
https://functionhealth.okta.com.

## Misc

You can ask setup/support questions in the `#ask-security-it` Slack channel.
