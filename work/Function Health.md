# Function Health

Many people have low-level risk factors, such as early signs of heart disease,
smoldering inside their body. But they can only take preventative action if
aware of potential threats. That's the philosophy behind Function Health, the
startup that's leading a new push toward proactive, preventive health care. For
\$499 a year, Function's hundreds of thousands of members get two rounds of
blood tests; an initial assessment with more than 100 tests, and then, three to
six months later, a followup including 60-plus retests to monitor how numbers
are changing. In May the company announced it acquired Ezra, allowing Function
to offer a full-body MRI that will take just 22 minutes and cost members an
additional \$499 (about one-third of what competitors charge). While Function
doesn't provide treatment, members get personalized insights and
recommendations from the company's team of clinicians. "It's the future of the
way people will manage their lifelong health," says co-founder and CEO Jonathan
Swerdlin. "We've been missing a platform or system that can help us manage our
health outside of acute issues."
